# What to expect in an engagement with _Opus Icon Advisory Group_

We'll interview your agile leaders to understand your process

We'll identify the decision frameworks you are following and lead you through a a self assessment of organizational maturity.

We'll work with you to develop a realistic roadmap to to organizational improvement, which will be translated into operational objectives and funneled into visual progress boards.

Requirements for other custom decision boards will be gathered for initial prototyping.

We'll do all this work in a demo ticketing environment that we'll set up for your IT leaders to be product owners. Of course, the Opus Icon will be the delivery team, but can be extended to other owners and managers of process.

At the conclusion of the engagement, the demo environment will continue to function as formalized Business Process Management with embedded risk management.

We'll design, build and implement an end to end process development life cycle, and will be both development and UAT and Training for all agile leaders. They will be able to determine acceptance criteria, as a required step in our planning and delivery.

For both the Process Development Live Cycle (PDLC) and the SDLC, we'll propose a series of meetings with all teams as the on-board the engagement. During the PDLC initialization, we'll determine if your're ticketing system has the required functionality, and or recommend one that does. (We have only proved functionality in the hosted version of JIRA to date.)

PDLC delivery will be end to end implementation of well defined and lightweight processes including meeting agenda, dashboards, process maps, custom fields, email notifications, and design, implementation, and refinement of your continuous improvement program on the PLDC side.

Successful milestones in your PDLC can be set as triggers for release into your SDLC processes or your target deliver teams.
